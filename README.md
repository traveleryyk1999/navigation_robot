- ## algorithm
  - used algorithms of RL(Reinforcement Learning), including q-learning, sarsa
  - **comment** and **uncomment** lines in the main function of /algorithm/navigation.py to test performance of robots with different strategies

- ## output log
  - the sample logs are save in /strategy_accuracy with the format of csv
